# 🔥 100Days-100Projects-JavaScript

Welcome to my **100 Days JavaScript Projects Challenge!**  
This is my personal journey to master front-end development by building **100 real-world projects in 100 days** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** — without relying on frameworks.

Each project focuses on building logic, UI, animations, and real functionality to improve my skills as a **full-stack JavaScript developer**.
